# Print the BMI of a user

You want to keep your data safe and calculate the BMI yourself.

In this activity, you'll write a script that will take variables and combine calculations to get a BMI result.

1. Create a `tracker.php`.
2. Define $name string to store the name of the user.
3. Define $weightKg integer to store the weight in kilograms.
4. Define $heightCm integer to store the height in centimeters.
5. Convert the height to meters.
6. Calculate the value of the height squared.
7. Calculate the BMI by dividing the user's weight by the value of the height squared.
8. Display the message to the screen displaying the name and BMI result.

There is a possible solution [here](./Activity_solution.php).
