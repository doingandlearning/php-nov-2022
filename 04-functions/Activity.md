# Creating a Calculator
You are working on a calculator-based web app. You are instructed to write a single function that is reusable for all the calculations needed.

1. Create function that will calculate and return the factorial of the input number. (5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1)
2. Create a function that will return the sum of the input numbers (a varying number of parameters). 
3. Create a function that will evaluate the $number input, which has to be an integer and will return whether the number is a prime number or not. The return value for this function is a Boolean.
4. Create a base performOperation function that will handle the predefined operations. The first parameter should be the operation ('factorial', 'sum', 'prime'). The remaining arguments should be passed to the mathematical function.

```php
/**
 * 
 * Description up here.
 * 
 * @param string $systemTempDirectory
 * @return string
 * 
 */ 
```
